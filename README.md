Please feel free to investigate different algorithms for the anomaly detection on the kddcup99 datasets.

* Machine learning classfiers (e.g. SVM,TSVM,Radom Forrest,RNN,etc.) in Python or Matlab;
* [AIS algorithms](http://www.artificial-immune-systems.org/algorithms.shtml) (e.g. NSA,Negative Selection Algorithms) in Python or Matlab;


Finally, conclude a comparation for the different algorithms.
